            <p>Your “About me” page forms the first impression of a company or product, puts a name and a face to your
                business, and gives website visitor the opportunity to develop a connection with you (a good reason for
                a visitor to stay on your website!), and it is your best chance to convert more visits to enquiries/more
                enquiries to customers.</p>

            <p>Ingredient properties are extracted both from the ingredient list, which includes some cooking actions,
                and from the textual preparation, from which the actions applied to the ingredients are extracted using
                NLP tools [8].</p>

                <p>The discourse representation is well adapted for solving some complex anaphoric phenomena appearing
                    in those types of texts. An example of a recipe used for property extraction is given in Extracting
                    the properties of the ingredient list. </p>

                <p>The quantities, the units, and the ingredient modifiers such as chopped , diced , crumbled , etc. are
                    also extracted. These modifiers are mostly cooking actions applied to the ingredients.</p>
